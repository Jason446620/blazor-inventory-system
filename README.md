# blazor-inventory-system
This is a single page inventory management system which allows a company to add, edit, and delete their office equipment.
In the future, I will be adding a back-end componenet with a database to make it a full-stack application.
I built this with C#, .NET Core 7.0. and Blazor WebAssembly.
